6.	Deployment: Hosted the system on a local server for demonstration and testing purposes.

**Tools and Technology**
1.	Programming Languages:
      •	Python (Flask for back-end development)
      •	HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for front-end design)
2.	Database:
      •	MySQL (via phpMyAdmin for database management)
3.	Frameworks:
      •	Flask (for web application logic)
      •	Jinja2 (for dynamic templating in HTML)
4.	Tools:
      •	Visual Studio Code (for development)
      •	Postman (for API testing)
      •	Browser Developer Tools (for front-end debugging)
5.	Libraries:
      •	Bootstrap (for responsive design)
      •	Flash (for user notifications)


**Conclusion**
